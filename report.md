## L293D Motor Driver

### Overview

The **L293D** is a quadruple high-current half-H driver, designed to control the direction and speed of motors. It is capable of driving two DC motors simultaneously in both directions. The L293D can handle up to 600mA continuous current per channel and up to 1.2A peak current, making it suitable for small to medium-sized motors.

### Key Features

- **Voltage Supply**: 4.5V to 36V
- **Current Handling**: 600mA continuous per channel, 1.2A peak
- **Number of Motors Controlled**: 2
- **Output Type**: Dual H-bridge
- **Thermal Shutdown**: Yes (built-in thermal protection)
- **Overcurrent Protection**: Yes

### ICs Used in L293D

The L293D IC uses **transistor pairs** to create the H-bridge circuit that controls the motor. These internal ICs include:

1. **NPN Transistors**: Used in the low-side switches of the H-bridge.
2. **PNP Transistors**: Used in the high-side switches of the H-bridge.
3. **Diodes**: Built-in diodes protect the IC from back electromotive force (EMF) generated by the motors during operation.

The combination of NPN and PNP transistors allows the L293D to switch the polarity of the motor's connections, enabling forward and reverse rotation.

### PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

PWM is a technique used to control the speed of motors by adjusting the duty cycle of a square wave signal. The L293D allows PWM to control the motorâ€™s speed by adjusting the average voltage supplied to the motor. By increasing the duty cycle, the motor receives more voltage and spins faster. Conversely, decreasing the duty cycle reduces the speed.

PWM is applied to the enable pin of the L293D. When the enable pin is high, the motor operates at full speed. By varying the duty cycle of the PWM signal, the speed of the motor can be controlled.

### H-Bridge Configuration

The L293D uses an **H-bridge** circuit to control the direction of current flow through the motor. An H-bridge consists of four switching elements arranged in a bridge configuration:

- Two high-side switches (usually PNP transistors).
- Two low-side switches (usually NPN transistors).

By activating different switches in the H-bridge, the L293D can change the direction of current flow, which changes the direction of the motor's rotation. The possible states of the H-bridge are as follows:

- **Forward Rotation**: One pair of switches (one high-side and one low-side) is activated.
- **Reverse Rotation**: The opposite pair of switches is activated.
- **Stop**: Both pairs of switches are turned off, stopping the motor.

The H-bridge configuration is crucial for enabling bidirectional motor control.

### Conclusion

The L293D motor driver is an essential component for motor control applications in robotics and electronics. It allows for simple control of the direction and speed of DC motors, thanks to its built-in H-bridge configuration and PWM support. With features like thermal and overcurrent protection, the L293D ensures safe and reliable operation, making it an ideal choice for many motor control projects.
